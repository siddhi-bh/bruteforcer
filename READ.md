# 🕵️‍♀️ Directory Bruteforcer (Python)

Hey! This is a little web security tool I built to **find hidden folders or files on websites** — like `/admin`, `/login`, `/secret-stuff` 👀

## 💡 Why I Made It

I was learning about how attackers or ethical hackers find **exposed paths** on websites, and I thought: “How hard could it be to write a tool like that myself?” Turns out — not that hard, and actually super fun 🤓💻

## 🔍 What It Does

- Takes a list of common directory names
- Tries each one on the website you give it
- Tells you which ones exist or are hidden

It's like a mini version of **dirb** or **dirbuster**, but made by me with 💜

## 🚀 How to Run It

```bash
python bruteforcer.py
